# sql-nanodegree
>This repository intends to show the details of the projects from the Udacity SQL Nanodegree Program taken by its owner.

The [SQL Nanodegre Program from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-sql--nd072) is a two-month course where the student will have access to a series of self-instructed videos in order to improve the skills knowledge in SQL with real-world projects from industry experts, technical mentor support, and more.

To consolidate your knowledge along the course, you will need to answer a lot of quizzes and exercises that will give you a better understanding of the language. Lastly, the student will face two challenging projects to demonstrate all the abilities acquired and deliver successful project solving. The two projects are:
 
* Deforestation Exploration
  - *In this project, you will act as a data analyst for an organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this important environmental topic. First, you’ll clean any erroneous values in a table, join that table to another lookup table to bring in a new categorical and quantitative variable, and return a new view of all categories greater than a reference value. Then, you will create and execute SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from those disparate data sets to answer questions for stakeholders.* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-sql--nd072).
* Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator
  - *In this project, you will build the supporting data structures for Udiddit, a social media news aggregator site. First, you’ll investigate the provided data model for potential errors such as lack of normalization, consistency rules, and proper indexing. Then, you will create a new, normalized database using DDL based on the denormalized one that is provided. Lastly, you will write DML queries to migrate the data from the denormalized schema to their normalized schema.* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-sql--nd072).
